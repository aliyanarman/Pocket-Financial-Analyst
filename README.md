## The Problem

You’re in a meeting. Someone’s talking IRR, MOIC, EBITDA multiples. You nod. Inside, you’re doing math on your feet, trying not to sound clueless.

Or you run multiple companies. You don’t have time to open Excel, pull comps across industries and countries, adjust for context, build forecasts, and double-check formulas just to answer one question: is this deal good or garbage?

Alight gives you institutional grade analysis in seconds. It generates a full memo with market positioning, comparable transactions, risk analysis, methodology of the analysis, the kind of work that normally takes hours, delivered in under a minute.

## How It Works

Pick an industry. Pick a country. Enter your numbers. Hit calculate.

The math happens instantly. The AI thinks for a second and voila, you get your answer with context about what typically happens in your industry, in your market, with deals like this.

If you're in tech in Pakistan, you'll see that 25-35% growth is possible but power outages are a risk.  
If you're in retail in the UK, you'll learn that high street stores are dying and 3% growth is the norm.  
If you're buying a healthcare business in the UAE, you'll hear that medical tourism is booming and expats pay well.

A 20% return in the US is great. In Pakistan, it's just okay (25% is the target because of inflation and risk). Alight adjusts for your market.
It learns from history. Alight will tell you if a similar deal crashed. WeWork thought it was a tech company. Theranos couldn't deliver. Alight remembers so you don't have to.

It's wonderful.

## Why It's Different

**It speaks like a human.**  
Instead of "Your IRR of 22.5% with a 3.2x MOIC exceeds institutional PE standards by +2.5pp, reflecting strong operational discipline"—you get: "Put in $100, walk away with $320. Most people want 20%, so you're doing better."

**It knows where you are.**  
A 20% return in the US is great. In Pakistan, it's just okay (25% is the target because of inflation and risk). Alight adjusts for your market.

**It learns from history.**  
The AI will tell you if a similar deal crashed. WeWork thought it was a tech company. Theranos couldn't deliver. Alight remembers so you don't have to.

**It writes like an analyst.**  
Need to send something official? Export a full investment memo. The AI doesn't just calculate—it researches comparable transactions, cites real deals (like TPL Properties' REIT launch or Lucky Landmark's PKR 15B development), discusses market risks (FBR valuation tables, currency volatility), and writes in the language your investors expect.

Example from a real export:
> "The proposed acquisition presents a compelling value proposition, characterized by an exceptionally strong EBITDA-to-cost yield and a projected IRR of 66.41%. When evaluating against regional benchmarks, the projected exit multiple reflects a premium valuation often reserved for Grade-A commercial developments in Karachi's Clifton District..."

That's not templated. That's generated. In 15 seconds.

**It gets out of your way.**  
When you calculate, the nav collapses to a tiny glass bar. The copyright notice fades in from blur. Everything feels like it was designed by someone who actually uses it.

## Who It's For

People who need answers, not process:
- Business owners evaluating acquisitions
- Investors sizing up opportunities
- Founders figuring out what their company is worth

If you've ever been in a meeting where someone said "let me run the numbers and get back to you," this is for you.

## The Stack

Built in vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks. No dependencies. No npm install hell.

The AI runs on Google Gemini Pro. It's prompted to be pragmatic and direct—no hype, no emoji, no "this deal is a unicorn 🦄" nonsense.

Country-specific data covers US, UK, UAE, and Pakistan across six industries. 10-year rolling averages so outliers (2020 pandemic, 2008 crash) don't skew everything.

Designed to work on your phone. The nav collapses when you calculate so you can actually read the results.
